# 508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum

The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).

Example 1:

Input: root = [5,2,-3]
Output: [2,-3,4]
Example 2:

Input: root = [5,2,-5]
Output: [2]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
